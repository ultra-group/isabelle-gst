High priority:
 ☐ Code for generating GST typeclasses by stitching together features
 ☐ Code for generating Model typeclasses by generating Variants operator  
     don't worry about automatic proving, just prove Variants_ZFP
     satisfies the axioms of each model spec typeclass
 ☐ Model for Ord (?) and OrdRec
 ☐ Feature and Model for Exception
 ☐ Examples from paper:
   ☐ ZF, ZFP, ZFO, ZFN, ZF+
 ☐ HTML output
   ☐ ROOT file for session
   ☐ makefile to build and generate HTML on new git pushes

Medium priority: 
 ☐ Model for Pair, Nat, Function

types for *dispatch*, type-directed dispatch 
  - do something to an object depending on its type
  - word needs to convey: sorting + doing
types for prediction
  - knowing what you can do with things
  - predicting things like "is this going to be well-defined"
  - what are the types of terms formed from these types
  - what theorems are true for these terms?
types for analysis 
formation restriction applies to grammar-like things

contributions:
 ☐ new feature of Isabelle for relativizing 
 ☐ lifting and transfer wisdom
