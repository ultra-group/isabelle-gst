High priority:
 ☐ Code for generating GST typeclasses by stitching together features
 ☐ Code for generating Model typeclasses by generating Variants operator  
     don't worry about automatic proving, just prove Variants_ZFP
     satisfies the axioms of each model spec typeclass
 ☐ Model for Ord (?) and OrdRec
 ☐ Feature and Model for Exception
 ☐ Examples from paper:
   ☐ ZF, ZFP, ZFO, ZFN, ZF+
   ☐ everything is a set
   ☐ ---- interesting choices ----
   ☐ everything is distinct 
 ☐ HTML output
   ☐ ROOT file for session
   ☐ makefile to build and generate HTML on new git pushes

 ☐ How to prepare for AFP

Medium priority: 
 ☐ Model for Pair, Nat, Function



Future work:
 ☐ Having everything built on top of ordinals, or functions
